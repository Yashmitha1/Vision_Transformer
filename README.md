## Overview

This project involves building a Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch, training it on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, and evaluating its performance using different hyperparameters. The project also explores transfer learning by fine-tuning a pre-trained ViT model for a scene recognition task.
